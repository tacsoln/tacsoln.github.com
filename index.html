Solutions

Secure Collateral. Globally

We specialize in providing highly skilled professionals with unique knowledge, skills, abilities and qualifications for domestic and international security requirements, as well as, specialized support equipment.  Our proven strategies to assess, design, and implement will deliver contract compliant personnel on time, at competitive rates with results.

While we draw from tested solutions and best practices, one size does not fit all. To this end, once we have a firm grasp of the problem, landscape, key stakeholders, and various opportunities ahead of us, we create a strategy that suits our client’s needs. 

Once our program, product, or service is designed, our team of experts sees it through at the ground level. We rely on operational expertise, past performance, and with local and client partners to ensure sustainability and relevance. When we design strategy, we do so with our client in mind; whatever we actuate has to be effective and provide ease of access by our clients. Absolute superiority is our starting point.

We collaborate with a wide network of partners in various regions (Africa, Middle East, and South Asia) to bring irreplaceable local knowledge and cultural context to our securities work.  With experienced personnel, state-of-the-art quality controls and vetting, MTS delivers a solution that sets itself apart from its competition.

Why Us
At the end of 2010, around 500 seafarers from more than 18 countries are being held hostage by pirates. Piracy clearly affects the world’s largest trade transport industry, but how much is it costing the world? One Earth Future (OEF) Foundation has conducted a large-scale study to quantify the cost of piracy.  Based on their calculations, maritime piracy is costing the international economy between $7 to $12 billion, per year. 
Despite the wide range of counter-piracy initiatives in place, all signs point to 2011 being another record-breaking year in terms of the number of pirate attacks, ransom payments and violence against seafarers. 	www.oceansbeyondpiracy.com
